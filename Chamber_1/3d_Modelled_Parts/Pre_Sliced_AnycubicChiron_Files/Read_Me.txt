Pre-sliced flies for Anycubic Chiron


The purpose of these files is to provide a "plug and play" option for those who would like to use the Anycubic Chiron to build their chambers. 


Simply copy the files onto a USB stick, and press print! No slicing required. 


"All parts together..." files represent the fastest method of printing for mass chamber production. HOWEVER, please consider that when printing many parts
at the same time, you can also loose many parts at the same time if printing errors are experienced. 


Single part options are perfect files to print when only one part is required. For example, if a part has been damaged in the field or during 
construction, a new one can be quickly printed and re-installed. 


This selection of files were sliced using Ultimaker Cura 4.11.0.
