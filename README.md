# AutoVent-Floating-GHG-Chamber
Automatically ventilating floating chamber, for measuring GHG fluxes from water bodies over greater temporal and spatial areas. Building higher resolution data sets through open source technology.

My Name is Ben Archer and I am currently a doctoral candidate working at the freshwater research institute IGB-Berlin (a Leibniz funded institute in Berlin Germany). My associated university is the TU-berlin (Technical univerity Berlin). 

My research focus is greenhouse gas fluxes from freshwater bodies. Throughout the work of my masters degree, I became aware of the heterogeneity of freshwaters and the need for a way to sample water bodeis over higher temporal and spatial resolutions, inorder to be able to form more accurate carbon budgets for freshwater systems.
