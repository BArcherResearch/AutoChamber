## Building an open-source community around the development and application of automatically ventilating floating greenhouse gas flux chambers. 


My name is ***** and I am currently a doctoral candidate working with *********

My research focus is greenhouse gas dynamics from freshwater bodies. In particular, the development of opensource technical solutions for the collection of GHG flux data over higher temporal and spatial resolutions than has typically been achievable with floating chamber methods, or without extensive engineering experience. 

The goal of this project is to provide all the information required for people, even those with little to no experience in 3d printing or the arduino environment, to be able to build a standardised automatically ventilating floating chamber system, capable of collecting GHG flux data of a quality suitable for publication. 

In doing so, the project aims to enhance the resolution of the global freshwater GHG budget by offering a solution that aligns with the philosophy and popularity of the floating chamber methodâ€”being low-cost, easily transportable and deployable, and requiring minimal construction skills.

By using 3d printing and universally available parts, the system aims to be standardised between research groups, eliminating the time investment, engineering skills and unrepeatability that often come with lab builds.

Developing the optimal system for these grand goals is an iterative and collaborative process. But with the release of "Chamber_1" as a part of my doctoral thesis, I hope to inspire the community and conversation around automatically ventilating chamber standardisation, and provide a case for what openSource science can achieve. 



## A note for those anxious about the 3d printing element of this project

If there is enough interest in the "Chamber_1" design or future designs/iterations, 3d printing (and thus subsequent post printing epoxy sealing steps) could be avoided or reduced by investing in injection moulding moulds and providing some of the parts as a kit; for example the main body and lid. 

This approach has been employed successfully by other opensource projects such as the "snowcat" by rctestflight (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/164488684/r-c-snowcat-tracks-rctestflight). Not only does this approach save lots of time that would otherwise be taken by printing, but also it reducing the cost of the individual parts (after the moulds have been funded of course) and ensuring the gas tight nature of the design. 

In the mean time, the cost of 3d printing has been taken into account by basing the build of Chamber_1 around the most economic FDM style printer available on the market at the time of publication, the **anycubic chiron**.

Additionally, the rise of consumer based 3d printers means that many universities and Maker spaces now have 3d printing facilities that students can utilise.

However if this is still not a possibility or to your taste, low cost **3d printing services** are now offered by external companies such as JLCpcb. By simply providing the projects stl files, you can have your parts printed and delivered.
